What is wxSkin?</a></h2>
wxSkin is a set of skinable controls (like buttons, checkboxes etc.) for the wxWidgets framework. "Skins" are sets of images which are used to create a GUI instead of using a standard interface. Therefor, when using wxSkins control, a GUI can be customized in many places, like we know most media players do. wxSkin tries to bridge the developer &lt;-&gt; user gap. It offers a simple API for developers who want to be able to have their applications (or part of it) "skinned". Users may change the look&amp;feel of the applications by changing to skins that suit their needs. As the "skin" format is the same for all wxSkin-based applications it is very simple for designers to create new skins.<p>
Here's a small example screenshot of wxSkin in action on Windows. <div align="center">

And here the same application and skin on my Gnome Desktop. <div align="center">

<h2><a class="anchor" name="why_skin">
Why wxSkin?</a></h2>
wxWidgets is a great cross-platform GUI framework, but it lacks the ability to easily create custum GUIs. Although wxWidgets primary goal is to use native controls where it is possible, there has been a demand in the community to have a simple way of creating skinned applications or customly shaped controls.<p>
wxSkin does not mean to replace anything in wxWidgets, but to offer a simple addon-API on top of wxWidgets to create customly shaped controls and applications.<p>
The difference between wxSkin and other projects, like wxUniversal, is, that wxSkin does not create GUIs using "renderers" (code snippets creating parts of a GUI), but image files. "Renderers" are not editable by users or designers unless they start coding. wxSkin offer a simple file format in XML that allows designer/users to create their own skins.<p>
Although it might have been possible to create wxSkin as a "renderer" for wxUniversal, I decided to create a new set of classes that can be used independently.<h2><a class="anchor" name="wxskin_how">
How does wxSkin work?</a></h2>
As I already said wxSkin comes as a set of new controls, each with the abiltiy to be skinned. Skin images can have any format that is supported by wxWidgets.<p>
Skins can have transparent sections that will be used to create the GUI elements shaped. The masks needed to shape a skin can either be created by specifying a mask colour for an image, or, if the image format supports it, by using an alpha channel. If wxSkin finds an alpha channel it will try to convert this to a mask for later usage.<p>
Although it is possible to create each skinned GUI control seperatly and pass it the images it would need to be properly created, wxSkin offers a much simpler way for controling the skinning process. wxSkin features a class called <a class="el" href="classwx_skin_engine.html">wxSkinEngine</a>, which is able to load and parse XML files. In these XML files you can specify the images to use for different controls, name these controls and pass additional options, like position and size. Through <a class="el" href="classwx_skin_engine.html">wxSkinEngine</a> you can assign GUI controls windows and associate them with label names. If <a class="el" href="classwx_skin_engine.html">wxSkinEngine</a> was able to parse the XML files and setup the associations, all you have to do is call a method that will intialize the new skin and recreate the whole GUI accordingly.<p>
Skin files that can be processed by <a class="el" href="classwx_skin_engine.html">wxSkinEngine</a> come in two falvors: As simple XML files containing the location of images to use, or as a self-contained zip archive. Normaly one would create the XML file and the skin images, place them in a directory with a structure of choice and then simply zip it up. The generated archive only has to follow three rules:<ol type=1>
<li>The XML file will have to be named skin.xml and located in the root of the archive.</li><li>When using an archive you can't reference images outside the archive.</li><li>The archive has to be in ZIP format.</li></ol>
<p>
Skin files can contain optional informations, like author, comment and screenshot. Through <a class="el" href="classwx_skin_engine.html">wxSkinEngine</a> this informations a easily accessible. For convenience there is <a class="el" href="classwx_skin_chooser.html">wxSkinChooser</a>, a simple frame that scans a directy hierarchy for files specified by a file mask and tries to get the info out of these files. It then creates a simple list of all found skin files with screenshots. When double-clicking a skin, <a class="el" href="classwx_skin_chooser.html">wxSkinChooser</a> will load the file and change the GUI skins.<h3><a class="anchor" name="skin_work">

<dl compact><dt><b><a class="el" href="todo.html#_todo000001">Todo:</a></b></dt><dd>Although wxSkin works properly in most cases, there still is some bug testing to do. Some things are still in a "planning" state, others might not work as expected.<ul>
<li>Support "proper" resizing for "complex" frames on all platforms (currently GTK is a bit buggy)</li><li>Sliders need some improvement regarding skinning and handling, as well as the ability to create it vertically.</li><li>Fix some deprecation warnings on Mac</li><li>Add font loading support</li><li>Add the ability to use GIF animations (e.g. for fancy moving progressbars)</li><li>Add a "knob" control that can be controled with the mouse</li></ul>
